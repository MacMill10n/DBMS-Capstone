# Basic DataBase Management Software
This is a captsone project for HyperionDev where the task entailed proucing a terminal based DataBase Management System.

The program was made in python using the SQLit3 library to write safe SQL that isn't vaulnerable to Injection.
The program should allow users to :
  - Back up and restore from a previous version.
  - Add and remove both books and authors.
  - Check and update the quantity of select books.

## Improvements that could be made
The program could be further improved by:
- using SQLit3's back up function instead of recreating the entire databse from by hand in code
- using Tkinter or Kivy to make the program more user accessible by implamenting a GUI
