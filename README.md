This is a captsone project for HyperionDev where the task entailed proucing a terminal based DataBase Management System.
The users should be able to :
  Back up and restore from a previous version.
  Add and remove both books and authors.
  Check and update the quantity of select books.

The program could be further improved by using SQLit3's back up function instead of recreating the entire databse from scratch
